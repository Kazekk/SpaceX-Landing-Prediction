# SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Prediction Project

## Project Overview

The SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Prediction Project is a data-driven endeavour aimed at forecasting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage during SpaceX rocket launches. This prediction holds significant importance as it directly impacts the cost-effectiveness of space missions, making SpaceX a cost-efficient alternative in the space industry.

## Project Stages

This project is meticulously structured, comprising the following essential stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Meticulously gathering data from a designated API, ensuring that it adheres to the required format for further analysis.

2. **Data Wrangling**: Conducting comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing operations to prepare the dataset for meaningful analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Delving into the dataset to extract valuable insights and visualizing key factors affecting the success of first-stage landings.

4. **Predictive Modeling**: Employing advanced machine learning techniques to construct predictive models that estimate the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing.

5. **Launch Site Locations Analysis with Folium**: Leveraging Folium to create interactive maps for an insightful analysis of SpaceX's global launch site distribution.

## Significance

The pivotal significance of this project lies in SpaceX's commitment to reducing the exorbitant costs associated with space exploration. By accurately predicting first-stage landings, we can estimate the overall launch costâ€”a crucial piece of information for organizations competing with SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.
